 and we experimented actually. So, you are saying that we have done the intuition on all patients NPDR, PDR. Serial NPDR and PDR patients. We have done all the serial NPDR patients that we thought it was all PDR actually. None of the NPDR patients, serial NPDR patients, same as like this. So, they are all PDR. PDR, yeah. Finally, it is all PDR. PDR. It is NPDR, right? Yes. and dense media obesity is my So like all these guys like we thought clinically it's either NVIDIA we did an octa and octa we picked up new SPS. That's remarkable. That's good. Based on octa then. Anyway 3-4 patients are there like that. So what is the patient search so that there is some There is some disparity between these two, the inclusion is slightly different. He will include all NPDRs. So you don't have all NPDRs. He will put only NPDRs. Okay, next what is your area of scan? Area of scan is 6 mm x 6 mm because intellect is having 6 mm So it is 3 into 3 So I have seen articles with 3 into 3 so that is why it is 3 into 3 And it is a SDOCC machine is having 5.7 mm into 5.7 mm. So, that is why we have to compare with the Intel 8, so it is 6 mm into 6 mm or 3 mm into 3 mm. So, it is somewhere at least 6 mm, that is why I took 6 mm. Then you cannot compare. You cannot compare 5.5 into 5.5 with 6 into 6. That is obviously different. But anyway, even though that is an area of capture, your analysis is on FAS and vessel density within the interiors. No, sir. Interiors actually I couldn't do. So, I took 3mm into 3mm grid vessel density. In the institution in Heidelberg? in Heidelberg because that was easy for doing it in Heidelberg. I didn't understand, how was it here? In the internet there are three grids, actually Vandermom into Vandermom grid, and Rehmom into Rehmom grid and ETDR's grid is there. ETDR though it comes as automatic values automated values we get in the internet But in the OCT machine we can do that ETDR set you know getting so as you said earlier I tried that method by which I took a printout of ETDRs but it was not fitting actually so I took the 3 mm into 3 mm it's not fitting on to the screen. Screen. It will really, like I'm also that SDOCT and FAS, it is coming. We have an option. But after binarization and all, we don't have an option like that. I understand. But the FAS is almost coming in. Like 3M. 3M. That's a medication factor. magnification factor is there in the machine display. Okay. I understood what you are trying to say. You are saying that the image that you see on the screen display. Yeah. When you put the 80 day start, 80 day start full the thing fills the pages. Yes, very well. That means the pages being blown bigger. Blown bigger So that means some magnification factor is already in place which actually this list We have to compare these two no But when we, but then we compare it with the 3mm into 3mm grid. Anyway, 3mm, 3mm grid is there in the internet. Like automated values. So, being. That is optimal grid, isn't it? No, E grid. This is all. So, we got this automated values like this. I have a question. What is the FAC? I have been accepting many media talks about FAC. What is the FAC? One portion, one quarter of FAC. Isn't it good to have a little bit of FAC? Especially in Fideli. Yes, FIDELI is superior to Jandru. That's right. This tile is not good. These people, this tile is not good. So, sir with the E2DS we have to make sure that SVO city also. Again that is the car. So, then you get an actual vessel density. If the actual vessel density is under the level. If the vessel density is under the level. But then also it was partly the airway. Yes, yes.

--- Segment 2 ---
 Yes. So, then when we magnify the SPOCT image. What is the show? Okay. The blue ones are the hypo areas. No, that's the yellow. That green or yellow. Is the SPOCT? This was the interlight dimension. That's the yellow. That's the yellow. That's the yellow. It is a similar thing. It is a similar thing. That's a clear one. Yes. I was wondering if there was a light flow. All the light flows are the same. Light does not... Light doesn't flow. Anyway. Anyway. So, we can't measure the height of the building. We can't measure the height of the building. Even then we had to uh measure it like into we had to measure the scale so it was 16 mm so divided into eight so that three mm we took half Deswegen I am sorry I am notpiercent of your team I apologize Paa Kak A A మిక్కోడ్ పారమాకిలార్ సందేసిలికార్ వాక్కే మినిస్టేలికార్ అందే ఇటెడియార్ సరిస్ స్వర్రి ము డాఉట్కులు వండి ఈటుడియారిస్ సోక్కులు అనీత్త చార్త సాఇస్ కొన్ని అలిక్కి ప్రాస్ట్ విషది అక్కా ఇమీయ్యంసో ఇద్ వాస్ నా క్రిక్టిక్ అంచ్లి తారు కేట్టిక్యంస్ తారు కేట్టిక్కి అంచ్లి అం 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 4th 5th 5th ఇలు ప్రిటి అవలా ఇలు ప్రిటి అలచునో స్రిస్రు దిను నוקూత మీర్చ్ సాఇస చాస్డిolutely పీ� subconscious పీడ్రం చాస్టి నియాదే నీమలి talked pan ఆపండించన్య హయ్కన్ పాత운데 కప్పటుకంతి మచ� Laurie Malone, ఐఫిలగన акళాంచి కదులకో ఇనిజువ్యించి మటుల� Laptop booster in conditions ధేడ్ వె చాబుండోంతే ఑డోం నీ పాదేచు. I write about this math When you come to make a presentation it should be very clear about all these things It is not about the right now we are in a very nascent stage. At this stage we are not expecting some data out of it. You have to think and dissect and what are every line that you say you think and analyze what questions you have to understand it first. When you understand first of these questions will come to your mind. How can I compare a big apple with a small apple? You cannot compare all these. How will I break down this big apple to a small apple and make it comparable. is there something that I can do? These things should naturally come to your mind only then these things will come up when it comes to the special and these things will come. So then now you're gonna find out, for example, like with this image, there's a piece of, definitely some studies that they use images.

--- Segment 3 ---
 that you study the that the go to the end of the paragraph which is devoted to how they do it. Some studies may clearly mention it and some studies may not mention it. They made a few studies to understand how they do. Go back to the machine try and adopt the same thing there. Maybe now you realize its not possible. Like you said some plugins are not there, so you have to download some more plugins. So, you have to refine, this is one of the risks only there is no into the other it is every week we will come we will post a new question we go back next week we will answer that single question we will post another set of questions to keep on going so so i think that should be refined when you come here now they need to we will spend some time for the sake of coming here and making a presentation we have to get this started So, imagine a can I show this is an image here. Yes. Okay. This is actually divided into four quadrants just like the previous image like this Is the size specific and the similar size are Did you bring it down to this size the size decrease soon and save it now yeah they're gonna four quarters and that is what was the scale in the initial actually into half so if the density of the density it's a little bit even a computer first questions live then it will just come with this images of their four values then first quarter and then a bus quarter there are a lot of different delay again in the video you may do you can define it in my game with that one to caliper we just drew it uh special density just click on that and it will come as 27.90 percentage no not at all here it is 20.94 Vincent one visit to do here it was 26 and here it was 22 it should be the other way around actually We need one more patient and it can be like. Now, let us go back to the other one. It is 27. So, 27. So, this is 27. Like, okay. So, this is percentage. Yes. Yeah, percentage. 27 percent of that area has the white blood. White, yes. Let me go back to the other one. That is 20. So, that means 21 percentage of me should be healthy. So, this is the. That is also deep, no? That is also deep. Both are deep. There seems to be a difference between these two. But both looks true. This looks like a design process and that looks like a illustrating process. There is a lot more dark blue there Yeah Centralized light. See, I think that means the other one is like. Yeah, I think it's like more like a rectangle, that's like more like a square. Second one, 35 is more like a square, right? The other one is looking more like rectangle, no? So, maybe the horizontal extension of the area is more, therefore, is that a difference? So, this is like getting a rich algorithm? Also. Also. Is it right or is it other algorithm? Other and different algorithm. Ah. In that term. Hmm. Also versus one lower. I read somewhere about this also that's why I went for that. This fun cell phone was not there inside. So that's the interesting thing that you found. So also like there are some references to that. Yeah. But then sir we also also This is better. You told me single digit number. Now this is a lot better. That's a sample.

--- Segment 4 ---
 That day when I showed, it was another patient. It was also coming like this when we did. See, the thing is, assuming that the area of scanning is the same, I don't know whether the area is the same in both the machines, the area is same. Assuming that the area is the same, it's okay to have the first. But now which is true is the in the which is true the the the SS after data is true or the SD after data is true is a is a that you tend to think that the is the SS after data is more true because like it is a direct measurement for the machine data. Whereas here now you have extrapolated it you have taken it and put it into a third for the software so there is some loss and some yeah could have happened but then it should decrease it's the other way there yes he said this is a magnified image and we need due to that if we define the size so i imagine the size of the 24 image martin contemporary renal rapidly கருந்தாயிரை murders negative ένα மாதக 얘는 கிளம் கைப்பாய்க்கmetics கிளம் கிளம் 0.799 மின்னியிட்டு ச்பாயர் ஏன் அது? I tell you it was you know this it was 1.0 something that was comparable to this one actually F engineering was comparable actually both got similar values near similar values That means the magnification is correct If the magnification is wrong then the area should be different right So, if the area is comparable between the two, then the magnification is correct. It is possible that there is more like a horizontal and vertical portion, maybe it is a rectangular square. That may be true. But the magnification is wrong. It is wrongly thought. otherwise this was 3mm into 3mm grid and this is the screenshot actually I think that is why it is seen as like enlarged 3 into 3 that is why it is 3 into 3 meaning 6mm it was I think that is what me and central we were telling actuallyION CUPPELY. sporty It is not actually reflective what is there in that So another one pretty fine There are some areas as a peneal, but there is also some blood vessels like there, they are not picked up. so . . . . It was not visible actually after binary session. I don't know, the other one is after binary session.

--- Segment 5 ---
 So, that one. This is a picture before bandwidth session actually. The vessel is going like this. We magnified and we saw actually. So, I think this is the screenshot. That is why it is not that clear. A vessel loom post going like this. This is before bandwidth. Before bandwidth session. So, they made after bandwidth. That's all. That is interesting. suit up. FEC area was comparable actually. But this maximum Even that is a compute I think it is comparable and not comparable and there is a difference which we can Why don't you do this as part of an exercise, but take a normal individual, nice healthy normal others take an image and see what results Okay Here you have ischemia and all that is something we don know that the vessel that is the but in a normal integer there is no ischemia it should have a So let us see if there is a difference between or what is the extent of difference between these two. There is a difference between these two with the essence of octal B showing lesser values than the SPOCT then that is going to be more magnified that effect of that difference degrees it is going to be more magnified when you have STB so that is only why now you have So, then we can actually come to that out. So, you do it put it in a page suppose like a we find that there is some difference then we will have to report it right. So, there is not something machine derived data. So, then we will take a set of normalize also like how you have chosen this so many other so many not one patient there is one patient a set of normal normalize do not have diabetes do not have diabetes at all not diabetic healthy normal young individuals and do the same thing. And then we can say, we will make a comment. Let us say this is comparable in data, but then, and then new machines, so doctor, under reports where there is a density. We only have the assume that it under under reports. There is few or not we don't know. But I think if we look at normal will give us an idea. It is one thing that one big question was that is that is a That is a cluster of vessels from. No, no, this is heart accident actually. This is a big clump of heart accident. I was saying that it's the same for... It's the same with the pig. What about heart accident? It was a big clump of heart accident It was actually It like that beyond that Here Like this here See there. There's the whole thing. Yes. This is something which is sitting in the middle. Yes. Yeah. So, it's a little soft. So, let's see where the machine is. If the machine is. Pick it up first. First. So, then. If you look at quadrant 2 and quadrant 3, all that will be part of bytes. Right, no. So that's the value which That could be, but even then this area it was 27 and there it was 20. There is no difference. There is no difference. What is the difference? 22? 27. When we look at 2236. One four. What are three? There is 28 and here it is 27. One five. город aditya. There are two important style holidays today. Yes.

With this OTSU algorithm and when we took this vessel density as rho without applying OTSU, it came similar. It came similar. I didn't understand. Sir, and this is raw data. Raw data meaning? But that machine value which was coming like very similar values. Meaning if you break it up into post files, you get similar values. Similar values. Only when you apply the algorithm, that value changes. No, value changes much. If it was like 27.9 instead, it will be like 27.89 something like that very similar values we got please uh denote of even a year Ar shutdown the inaudible you know you are able to get one and that value was comparable to this also algorithm. That value is comparable to also algorithm. Sorry we conclude that and what we are doing correct. It's not solved our difference between, it's a software. It does not answer that question. That is, that's surprising. What is so surprising in that? Other algorithms also I will apply and see. If you see, there will be a minor difference between the base value and the algorithms. I don know exactly how that thing works So that will be obviously related to the base image I thought you said that the base image value is comparable to the SS of that. No. Okay. Then I thought why are all of them spoilt. No. Okay. So, I think this probably not representative case that is why we are getting more confused I have feeling that it is not representative case but apply it to realize you are not always going to have publicly so whenever you have disease pathology how does it affect it is nice how does it brought out the point hard which is nice to look at in all different parameters like for example somebody with thick you know with the macular region versus with the no macular region with hard exudates no hard exudates that is a good that is another thought process that comes to me that is why you can look at these things and say that okay that with these changes no the character of this analysis changes is something that you can say that is also a good thing I do not know that somebody else is saying that

--- Segment 7 ---
 mentioned that so here in this interlight picture also this thing is there same that white thing although this is a bandage image it is more prominent when it's called virus uh you know by virus exchange becomes more prominent this is the original of that is the the octane wheels. Here also we can see back in this interlapid. The system is there. Is there a CMU there? Is there a CMU there? Is there a service system? Service system, yes. But we hard-exit it. We pump off hard-exit it, possibly. So all through all the legs. How do you think hard-exit is? One more time. Hard-exit is, say why does SSPM happen is because now there is fluid and inside of fluid there is some movement of the fluid this is just it is filled with fluid and the fluid is not clear it is solid but there is thermal energy has enough clear flow and there is a small movement of the, I don't know what I am doing, just the particles amongst the fluid. The machine senses that as RPC moment. So, that is where you get some kind of reflectivity, looks like, you know, looks like reflectivity, looks like, so that is SSPA. If you are clear of fluid, it is not going to happen. There is no movement, the movement is not perceived by the machine. Particular moment is not perceived by the machine. Harder channel, there is no movement. It is still there. So between two OCT or after attacks after attack is not going to differentiate the movement between these two guns So why did it show the reflectivity it should not show the picture unless there is an over lined area of you know okay So, anyway let us not wait till next class. So, in this class you come up with the final data. you work on the normal analysis, we will check it and see and the next class we will bring out with the excel data and then we will analyze. How many cases did you get? I think it was 10,000 cases. 10,000 cases, last year it was 10,000. So, you send this to K-1, you get, you look at some of the old population and get an abstract ready except the numbers, numbers . . Okay. So, will you be able to do that? Yes sir. Before the month end, then you also send an abstract. Yes sir. to abstract any item with that. Okay. So, will you be able to do that? Yes sir. Before the month end then you also send an abstract. Yes sir. Because when you send an abstract and then when you go through text and all that there will be some movement something will happen otherwise we go on like this. Okay. Okay, so because end of this month, so common analysis we done and we have to send it outside.
